# API Base URL
# For development: use http://localhost:8080 (direct backend access)
# For production with nginx: use empty string "" (generated API code already has /api prefix)
# Note: Orval generates API calls with /api prefix, so baseURL should not include /api
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
