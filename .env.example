# Docker Compose Project Configuration
# This file contains environment variables for Docker Compose setup.
# Copy this file to .env and customize the values for your environment.

# Project Name (used for container and volume naming)
# This should be unique per worktree to avoid naming conflicts.
# Default: sandbox-dev
# Examples: sandbox-dev, feature-auth, bugfix-123
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=sandbox-dev

# Port Offset
# Add this value to all port numbers to avoid conflicts when running multiple environments.
# Default: 0 (no offset)
# Common values: 0 (main), 1 (e2e), 100, 200, 300, ... (for worktrees)
PORT_OFFSET=0

# Calculated Port Numbers (automatically set by setup-worktree-env.sh)
# These are the actual ports exposed on your host machine
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
BACKEND_PORT=8080
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
DEBUG_PORT=5005
NGINX_PORT=80

# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_DB=sandbox
POSTGRES_USER=sandbox
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=sandbox

# Database Persistence Mode
# - volume: Persistent storage (default, data survives container restart)
# - tmpfs:  Temporary storage in memory (faster, data lost on restart)
# Use tmpfs for temporary testing or CI environments.
DB_PERSISTENCE_MODE=volume
